A yearly compendium of bills in the New York State Senate.

## Requirements

You will also need an [API key](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/). At the root of this project, create a `.env` file and paste your key like so:

```

## Development with Docker

- Make your code changes! Only the frontend will be live-reloaded whenever you save.

## Development with Node locally

- make sure you have [redis](https://redis.io/) running: `redis-cli ping`
- in `backend`, run `npm i` and then `npm run dev`
- in `frontend`, run `npm i` and then `npm start` and hit Enter when prompted about ports
